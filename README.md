Hi there 👋  

## 👋 About Me
I'm documenting my **90-days internship journey as a Junior Data Analyst**.  
This repository is a place where I share my learning progress, projects, and hands-on experience in the field of data analytics.

📊 **Data Analytics** is the process of analyzing large datasets to discover patterns, trends, and meaningful insights that support data-driven decision-making.

Currently, I am focusing on improving my skills in data processing, analysis, and visualization as part of my commitment to continuous learning and professional growth.
